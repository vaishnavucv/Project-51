-   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4421ada1-1344-4b40-8a31-9dd092338eaa" width="28"> -  **Research & Advanced Security** – Smart contract auditing, ICS/IoT security, side-channel attacks, nation-state malware analysis.
-   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e22786f9-87d3-4001-b71b-06b1ab8c56f1)" width="30"> -  **Project 51 (Capstone)** – A Cybersecurity Mega Range that unifies all 50 projects into a single simulation environment with offense, defense, crypto, and research modules.

The repo is structured into three levels:

-   L1 – Beginner → Foundational labs & tools.
-   L2 – Intermediate → Real-world applied security.
-   L3 – Advanced → Enterprise, research & nation-state level security.

Each project folder includes:

-   📖 Documentation (README.md)
-   🧪 Lab Setup Guide
-   💻 Source Code / Scripts
-   📊 Reports

This project is ideal for students, professionals, and trainers aiming to master cybersecurity end-to-end through structured, hands-on labs.

## 🚀 **Project 51: Cybersecurity Mega Range (Unified Capstone Project)**

### **Concept**

A full-fledged Cybersecurity Simulation Environment that integrates:

- **Offensive Security (Red Team)** → Password cracking, phishing, exploits, malware, rootkits
- **Defensive Security (Blue Team)** → IDS/IPS with ML, SIEM, anomaly detection, forensic analysis
- **Cryptography & Privacy** → TLS, 2FA, PKI, secure comms, zero-day crypto research
- **Research & Enterprise Security** → ICS, IoT, side-channel, malware obfuscation, smart contracts

This project will be a modular cyber range where every project (1–50) is represented as a lab module that can be enabled/disabled.

### **Architecture (High-Level)**

#### **Infrastructure Layer**
- Docker/Kubernetes setup for multi-containers (Attacker, Defender, Victim, Analyst)
- Simulated enterprise environment (Windows, Linux, IoT, ICS VMs)

#### **Offensive Labs (Projects 1–20)**
- Honeypots, spoofing, exploits, reverse engineering
- Malware creation + obfuscation + keylogger integration

#### **Defensive Labs (Projects 21–35)**
- IDS/IPS (Snort + Suricata + ML models)
- Full-disk encryption, PKI, anomaly detection dashboards
- Threat intel honeypots and SOC logging

#### **Advanced Research Labs (Projects 36–50)**
- Smart contract auditing
- IoT and ICS attack-defense
- Rootkits, kernel backdoors, and side-channel attack demonstrations

#### **Integration Layer**
- Unified dashboard for monitoring (Splunk/ELK + Grafana)
- Attack simulation → Defense detection → Forensic analysis → Report generation

### **Learning Outcomes**
- Learners can simulate a real cyber range with attack + defense
- Provides end-to-end exposure from beginner concepts to nation-state threat simulations
- Acts as a portfolio project proving full-spectrum cybersecurity expertise
