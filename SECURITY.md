## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Project-51** is an educational resource. However, we take the security of our lab scripts and infrastructure seriously. 

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project (e.g., in a lab script or a setup guide that could expose a user's system), please follow these steps:

1.  **Do not open a public issue.**
2.  Email your report to [vaishnavu's contact/LinkedIn].
3.  Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and possible remediation.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a resolution.
